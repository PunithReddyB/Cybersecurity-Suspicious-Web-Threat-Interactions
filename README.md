# Cybersecurity-Suspicious-Web-Threat-Interactions
A cybersecurity data analysis project using Python, ML, and visualization to detect threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and predict intrusions. Built during my internship with Unified, it identifies suspicious access patterns, peak attack times, and provides insights for stronger security systems.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Cybersecurity data analysis to detect threats, analyze vulnerabilities, and strengthen system security. It uses data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to identify suspicious activities and support proactive defense strategies.

👉 This work was completed as part of my internship with Unified.

📂 Scope of the Project

• Detection of abnormal or malicious activities in the dataset
• Analysis of user access logs and network behavior
• Identification of attack patterns and vulnerabilities
• Application of machine learning for predictive threat detection

⚙️ Project Workflow

• Data Preprocessing
• Cleaning raw logs and normalizing data
• Handling missing values and anomalies

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Analyzing login attempts, access patterns, and suspicious IPs
• Identifying peak times for potential attacks

• Feature Engineering
• Extracted features like failed logins, access frequency, and anomaly scores

• Model Building
• Applied classification algorithms for threat detection
• Evaluated models for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

• Visualization
• Plotted attack trends over time
• Showed risky users/IPs with graphs and charts

📊 Results & Insights

• Identified multiple instances of suspicious access attempts
• Machine learning models helped predict possible intrusions
• Visualizations highlighted peak attack times and vulnerable entry points
• Insights useful for building real-time cybersecurity defense systems
